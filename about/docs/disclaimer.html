    <h1>Disclaimer</h1>

    <p>
      PandaStake operates exclusively on the Sepolia testnet. All staking, withdrawal, and network statistics (“Network Stats”) rely on simulated data for demonstration and educational purposes only. You are not exposed to any real financial risk, nor are you executing genuine transactions on the Ethereum mainnet. In the future, we intend to launch PandaStake on the Ethereum mainnet, but until that time all operations remain strictly testnet-based.
