    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>
      PandaStake operates exclusively on a testnet environment. All staking, withdrawal functionality, and network statistics (“Network Stats”) rely on simulated data solely for demonstration and educational purposes. You are not engaging in real transactions and are not exposed to any genuine financial risk at this time.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the future, we plan to launch PandaStake on a mainnet to enable real staking and withdrawal operations on a live blockchain. Until that point, all features and interfaces remain strictly testnet-based. By using the Platform, you understand and agree that current functionality is limited to demonstration only, with true mainnet features to be rolled out at a later development stage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not all modules or pages of PandaStake are fully available or operational at this moment. Certain sections—such as presale registration, swap interface, and advanced PANDA token staking—are under active development and may be partially inaccessible or contain bugs. By continuing to use the Platform, you accept that some features may be inactive, may not work as intended, or may change without prior notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>User Obligations:</strong> You agree to use the Platform responsibly and refrain from any actions that could harm or disrupt PandaStake—this includes, but is not limited to, hacking attempts, denial-of-service attacks, spamming, or manipulation of simulated data. You must not provide false information, impersonate others, or attempt to defraud the system. You bear sole responsibility for your own hardware, software, and testnet wallet configuration (e.g., MetaMask) needed to interact with Sepolia.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> All content on PandaStake—graphics, text, source code, the PandaStake brand, and logos—is owned by PandaStake or its licensors and is protected by copyright law. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or publicly display any Content without PandaStake’s express written permission. Any suggestions, feedback, or bug reports you submit may be used by PandaStake in its sole discretion without obligation to grant you any license, credit, or compensation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> PandaStake provides the Platform “as is” and disclaims all warranties—express or implied—regarding its merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, or reliability. Under no circumstances shall PandaStake, its founders, officers, employees, affiliates, or partners be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages— including but not limited to lost profits, data loss, service interruptions, or costs of procuring substitute goods or services—arising from or relating to your use of (or inability to use) the Platform, even if PandaStake has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>No Guarantee of Continuous Availability:</strong> The Platform may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, technical issues, or other unforeseen events. PandaStake does not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation and reserves the right to suspend or restrict access at any time without notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Modifications to the Platform and These Terms:</strong> PandaStake reserves the right to modify, enhance, or remove any features, functionality, or interface elements of the Platform at its sole discretion, without prior notice. These Terms may be updated periodically, and all changes take effect immediately upon posting. It is your responsibility to review these Terms regularly. Continued use of the Platform following any changes signifies your acceptance of the updated Terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Governing Law and Jurisdiction:</strong> These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where PandaStake is incorporated. Any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the Platform shall be resolved exclusively by the competent courts in that jurisdiction, notwithstanding any conflicts-of-law provisions.
    </p>
